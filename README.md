# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

This website functions as a weather forecast. If the user wants to find out the weather of a city today as well as 5 days from today, all they need to do is type in the city name and search. If the user wants to go back and see what weather for all the cities they searched, they can click on the button on the left hand side of the page. My motivation from this project came from whenever I travel or drive to a new city and I want to know what the weather will be like for the days that I stay there. I built this project for people who want to check the weather and all the detailed facts such as humidity and wind speed. This project utilized multiple apis from openweathermap, and even used one api response to call another api.
